# Meeting Place

Raekoja plats is the center square of Old Town. You can take public transport to Hobujaama, Estonia or Balti Jaam bus stop but will have to walk to Old Town from there. It is a 3 min walk from Hobujaama bus stop and Viru Keskus shopping center. We will meet under the medieval city council building with a tower.

# Parking

We will be meeting in the center of the Old Town. It is possible to park in the Old Town, but the parking spots are very limited and mobile parking needs to be used â€“ it might be a bit difficult to set up.

Nearby is the Freedom Square Parking lot with parking tickets (5 min walk), Solaris mall parking lot with parking tickets (8 min walk) and Viru keskus mall parking lot with parking tickets (8 min walk). But if you stay close to Old Town, it is also easy to just take a walk there:)
